# r_grn
I developed this R code to analyze given data about genes, my role was to determine the number of peaks (open regions) and sizes in each gene and to show it in a distribution. I first had to find the Transcription Start Site (TSS) depending on the strand of the chromosome of each gene (positive or negative), then I had to find the number and sizes of the peaks within a specified region.
